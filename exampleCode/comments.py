# Comments are not necessary for code to run but makes
# your code easier to understand
# Primarily used for debugging and breaking down other
# programmers code

# Types of  comments are the "document string" and
# "comment"
#  The document string is a short decription for your
# function that comes immediately after the function
# creation. It uses triple quotes.

# Comments are notes that are completely ignored by the
# computer and declared with a # symbol.
# It is a way to leave a message. It is also a way to comment
# out broken code

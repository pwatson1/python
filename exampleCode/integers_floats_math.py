# Python has a built-in math function. It works with (+ add),
# (- minus), (* multiply), (/ divide), ("()" parenthesis),
# (** power), and (% remainder)

# You can also convert integers to floats and floats to integers
# normally if you divide 3 by 2 in python you get 1 loosing the
# number after the decimal
3/2

# However if at least one number uses a floating decimal the
# result will be a number with a floating point

3/2.0

# You may also convert the answer by explicitly identify one of
# numbers as a float or int
float(3)/2

int(3.0)

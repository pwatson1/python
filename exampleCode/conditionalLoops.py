# Conditionals are a way to check for something
Example:

if(we have mail):
    get mail

# elif is used if there are multiple conditions and comes after if
elif(the mailman is late):
    come back

# else catches anything that does not meet the conditon
# of the if or elif statements
else:
    cry


Example2:

mail = 5

if mail:
    print "mail time!"


Example3:

mail = 0

if mail:
    print "mail time!"
else:
    print"no mail ):"


# Using operands for conditionals
if(4<6):
    print "new that."


if(7<6):
    print "whaaa"
else:
    print "greater than 6."


# this asks is there a value in the parenthesis and if so print
# the statement. This would be true unless we are dealing with zero.
if(7) and (6):
    print "yep"

Zero Example:
# All numbers make the and statement true except zero
if(0) and (4):
    print "whaaa"


# The not key word is a way of reversing the condition
if not(0):
    print "yes"

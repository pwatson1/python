# A Finite State machine is a way of controling and
# organizing program logic .  It's often used to program
# artificial inteligence

# Finite means there is a limited but known number of states.
# A state is how something is in the moment. Ex. cold, hot, gas
# liquid, solid, on, off

# A machine is something automated

# With a finite state machine the program can usually only have
# one active state at a time unless you program it otherwise

# Step 1 - diagram out your thoughts with circles for states
# Step 2 - draw arrows between circles that represent transitions
# one way between states. This creates a network. Each arrow
# describes a condition as to why one state changes to another

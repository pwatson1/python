- Break up code into modules or chunks based on funtionality
- Prevents having supper long files and having to scrole forever
- Easier to manage and edit
- Allows for easier reuse in the future

Importing:
    - the file that you are importing from must be in the same
        directory as the other file

Suggestions:
    - Each base class gets its own file

    Physics.py
    Collision.py
    AI.py
